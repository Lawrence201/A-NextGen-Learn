Great question, Lawrence!

In a simple and structured way, DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is divided into two major categories, and each of them has subparts. Here‚Äôs how it breaks down:

üß† 1. Data Structures (DS)
These are ways of organizing and storing data.

A. Linear Data Structures
Array

Linked List

Stack

Queue

B. Non-Linear Data Structures
Tree (Binary Tree, BST, AVL, Heap, Trie)

Graph (Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted)

C. Hashing
Hash Table / Hash Map

Collision Handling (Chaining, Open Addressing)

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Algorithms (A)
These are step-by-step procedures to solve problems using data structures.

A. Searching Algorithms
